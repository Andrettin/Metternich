	description = "German astronomer, he was the pupil and associate of George Purbach from 1452 at Vienna, and they jointly undertook a reform of astronomy rendered necessary by the errors they detected in the Alphonsine Tables. In 1471 Regiomontanus settled at Nuremberg. Bernhard Walther, a rich patrician, became his pupil and patron; and they together equipped the first European observatory, for which Regiomontanus himself constructed instruments of an improved type. His observations of the great comet of January 1472 supplied the basis of modern cometary astronomy."
