When marking advisors as belong to a country in their history, the following guidelines were used:
1. For inventors and artists, they were assigned to the country when they entered its service.
2. For governmental decision-makers, they were assigned to the country when they became ministers.
3. Advisors were not deassigned from the country when they left service or died, as that is handled more appropriately by technological obsolescence. Otherwise advisors might be removed from a country via history, but then immediately be available when beginning the game since they aren't obsolete yet.
