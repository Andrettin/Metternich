After taking part in the battles of Amberg and Würzburg in 1796 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and in 1799 he was promoted lieutenant field marshal. In 1813, when Austria, after many hesitations, took the side of the allies against Napoleon, Schwarzenberg, recently promoted to be field marshal, was appointed commander-in-chief of the allied Grand Army of Bohemia. As such he was the senior of the allied generals who conducted the campaign of 1813-1814 to the final victory before Paris and the overthrow of Napoleon."

On March 7th 1849 a centralized constitution for the whole Austrian monarchy was proclaimed. His refusal to incorporate only the German provinces of the monarchy in the proposed new German Empire had thrown the German parliament into the arms of Prussia. His success in restoring the status quo ante of the German Confederation, with the old predominance of Austria, was largely due to his diplomatic skill, unscrupulousness and iron tenacity of purpose."
