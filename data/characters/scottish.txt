For its illumination he introduced an improved apparatus, and he was also the author of various valuable inventions in connexion with lighting, including the intermittent and flashing lights, and the mast lantern for lightships. As a civil engineer he improved the approaches to Edinburgh, constructed harbours, docks and breakwaters, improved river and canal navigation, and constructed several important bridges. He was the inventor of the movable jib and balance cranes."
